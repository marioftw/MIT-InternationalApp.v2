    <h1 class="mat-h1">Terms of Service</h1>
  
    <p style="margin-left: 0;">These terms and conditions (“Agreement”) set forth the general terms and conditions of your use of 
        the “MIT International App” mobile application (“Mobile Application” or “Service”) and any of its 
        related products and services (collectively, “Services”). This agreement is legally binding between 
        you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and Manukau Institute of Technology (“Institute”, “we”, “us”, or 
        “our”). Suppose you enter into this agreement on behalf of a student who has formally assigned you 
        to represent them. In that case, you represent that you have the authority to bind such student to 
        this agreement, in which case the terms “User”, “you”, or “your” shall refer to such student. If you 
        do not have such authority or disagree with the terms of this agreement, you must not accept this 
        agreement and may not access and use the MIT International App and its services. By accessing and 
        using this application and its services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree 
        to be bound by the terms of this agreement. You acknowledge that this agreement is a contract 
        between you and the Institute, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by you. It 
        governs your use of this application and its services.
